    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "The three models I've picked that I believe would be a good fit for this classification problem are as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Decision Tree\n",
    "2. Random Forests \n",
    "3. Logistic Regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Tree: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Decision Trees are used in the medical industry to predict illnesses. E.g decision trees can be used for the detection of Breast cancer based on certain features. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00521-012-1196-7\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  One of the major strengths of Decision Trees are that they are easy to intepret and explain. Another advantage of Decision Trees are it's ability to assign a specific categorical value to an outcome. E.g Will a student be admitted to a college? The Decision Tree will classify this into a categorical Yes or No outcome. Decision Trees tend to perform well when the dataset is large and is not prone to sudden changes. As for a small data set, DTs can lead to overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Decision Trees tend to be unstable, meaning a small change in data can lead to a large change in how your decision trees tend to perform. Decision Trees also tend to be high variance classifiers, also the tree structure of DT's can be prone to sampling if your training set data is slighlty different from your testing set data. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Since we're dealing with a classification problem and with categorical features we have I think the Decision Tree would be a great fit. But I do believe a random forest of decision trees will perform better but I wanted to carry out a comparision on how the results would compare between normal decision trees and a random forest of decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forests: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Random Forests are used to detect Diabetic retinopathy by inputing fundus photography images. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4062420/\n",
    "\n",
    "2. One of the major strengths of Random Forest is that it has very quick runtimes. Another major strength of Random Forests is that it performs pretty well even with small datasets. It also tends to perform better with classification problems. (can be applied to regression problems as well but the results and output can vary and be limited.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. One of the weaknesses of random forests is that it tends to overfit. You also need to define the number of trees you want to generate and it also tends to perform pretty badly when outcomes or predictiors are pretty rare. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Again since we're dealing with a classifcation problem with categorical features with no major outliers I think the Random Forest algo will be a great fit for this particular problem and as the data set isn't too large with 45000 samples I believe RF would give good results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Logistic Regression is used in the banking industry to predict if a loan is a good loan or a bad loan. http://ucanalytics.com/blogs/case-study-example-banking-logistic-regression-3/\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Since logistic regression output lies between a 0 and 1 they have nice probabilistic interpretation to it and the model tends to avoid overfitting. Another major strength of logistic regression is that it deals pretty well when new data is introduced because of gradient descent. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. In Logistic regression as per my understanding the data points must be independent to each other. If they are not independent the model will not work very well and it can lead to overfitting. Meaning the model does not do well to capture complex relationships. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Since we're dealing with a yes or no calssification problem (binary 0 or 1) I believe this would be a good fit. Plus the data is very clean and I think will perform very well on our data set. \n"

I think Logistic Regression will give the best results because the prediction and training time is pretty low as compared to the prediction/training times of Random Forest. It also gives the highest accuracy on the testing set and is not prone to overfitting as much as RandomForest/Decision Trees. This can be seen from the accuracy scores on the training sets. "

    "Logistic Regression is basically the probability of an event happening or not. Meaning it's either a 1 or 0. It uses the logistic function to find a model/s curve that fits the data points. \n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression uses the concept of odds ratios to calculate the probability. This is defined as the ratio of the odds of an event happening to its not happening. For example, the probability of a sports team to win a certain match might be 0.75. The probability for that team to lose would be 1 – 0.75 = 0.25. The odds for that team winning would be 0.75/0.25 = 3. This can be said as the odds of the team winning are 3 to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression makes predictions using probability, e.g adding on the above let us assume that: \n",
    " 0 = Zero chance of a student being admitted.\n",
    " 1 = 100 percent chance of a student being admitted \n",
    " > 0.5 We are farely confident that the student will be admitted. \n",
    " \n",

    "### Implementation: Model Tuning\n",
    "Fine tune the chosen model. Use grid search (`GridSearchCV`) with at least one important parameter tuned with at least 3 different values. You will need to use the entire training set for this. In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).\n",
    "- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.\n",
    " - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
